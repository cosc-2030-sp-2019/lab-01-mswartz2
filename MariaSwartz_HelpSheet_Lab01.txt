Lab 00:
1. To comment things out in C++ use "//" for a single line and "/*" and "*/" for a block of code
2. To comment things out in Python use "#"
3. A mark down file has a .md extension

Lab 01:
1. With an array ARRAY, you can use ARRAY.find_last_not_of(whitespace) to strip the last character from the string you are inputing.
I found that this also takes away the last character, so it is more beneficial to use (ARRAY.find_last_not_of(whitespace) + 1) to 
strip the final whitespace.
