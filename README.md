For Lab 01:  Process Numbers and Compress Data

Statement of help: I recieved help from Dr. Hll, Stefan Emmons, Pedro Marquez, Dr. Hill, and the assigned readings for this class

Since the format for pixels is hexidecimal, it is possible that we could have a flag character that could be confused as a pizel. This could happen with the "00000000" flag character that we were originally given. This is a possibility with the BMP file.

To fix this, I changed the flag character to the word "flag" in the program which reduces confusion.
